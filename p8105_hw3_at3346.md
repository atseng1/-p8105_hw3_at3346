Load data:

``` r
data("instacart")

The `instacart` dataset contains 1384617 observations (representing
products from orders) of 131,209 unique users and 15 variables. There is
a single order per user in this dataset. Key variables in the
`instacart` dataset include `reordered`, which describes if this product
has been ordered by this user in the past,`order_dow`, which describes
the day of the week on which the order was placed, and
`order_hour_of_day`, which describes the hour of the day on which the
order was placed.
